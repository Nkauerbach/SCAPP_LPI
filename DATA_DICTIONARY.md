## üìä LPI Score Components & Methodology

### Overall LPI Score (Scale: 1-5)
The LPI is calculated as the weighted average of six key dimensions:

#### 1. Customs (Weight: ~16.7%)
- **Definition**: Efficiency of customs and border management clearance
- **Measurement**: Speed, simplicity, and predictability of formalities
- **Scale**: 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)

#### 2. Infrastructure (Weight: ~16.7%)
- **Definition**: Quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure
- **Includes**: Ports, airports, roads, railways, warehouses, telecommunications
- **Scale**: 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)

#### 3. International Shipments (Weight: ~16.7%)
- **Definition**: Ease of arranging competitively priced shipments
- **Measurement**: Cost-effectiveness and efficiency of shipping services
- **Scale**: 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy)

#### 4. Logistics Quality and Competence (Weight: ~16.7%)
- **Definition**: Competence and quality of logistics services
- **Includes**: Transport operators, customs brokers, forwarders
- **Scale**: 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)

#### 5. Tracking and Tracing (Weight: ~16.7%)
- **Definition**: Ability to track and trace consignments
- **Measurement**: Information systems and transparency
- **Scale**: 1 (very low) to 5 (very high)

#### 6. Timeliness (Weight: ~16.7%)
- **Definition**: Timeliness of shipments reaching destination within scheduled time
- **Measurement**: Frequency of on-time delivery
- **Scale**: 1 (nearly never) to 5 (nearly always)

### LPI Calculation Formula
```
LPI Score = (Customs + Infrastructure + Int_Shipments + Logistics_Quality + Tracking + Timeliness) / 6
```

## üìà CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) Methodology

### Definition
CAGR represents the mean annual growth rate over a specified time period, assuming annual compounding.

### Formula
```
CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Number of Years) - 1
```

### Application in This Project
- **Time Period**: 2007-2023 (16 years)
- **Beginning Value**: LPI Score in 2007 (or earliest available year)
- **Ending Value**: LPI Score in 2023 (or latest available year)
- **Result**: Expressed as decimal (e.g., 0.025 = 2.5% annual growth)

### CAGR Categories (Quintiles)
| Quintile | Rank | CAGR Range | Performance Level |
|----------|------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Top 20% | Highest CAGR values | Excellent |
| 2 | 60-80% | Above median | Good |
| 3 | 40-60% | Around median | Average |
| 4 | 20-40% | Below median | Below Average |
| 5 | Bottom 20% | Lowest CAGR values | Poor |

## ‚ùó Data Limitations & Considerations

### Survey Limitations
- **Self-reported data**: Based on perceptions of logistics professionals
- **Survey bias**: May reflect respondent experiences rather than objective measures
- **Country participation**: Varies by survey year due to capacity or political factors

### Temporal Considerations
- **COVID-19 Impact**: 2023 survey may reflect pandemic-related logistics disruptions
- **Economic cycles**: LPI scores may be influenced by broader economic conditions
- **Infrastructure development**: Major infrastructure projects may not be immediately reflected

### Statistical Considerations
- **Sample size**: Varies by country and survey year
- **Interpolation**: Some data points estimated using cubic spline methodology
- **CAGR assumptions**: Assumes consistent growth patterns, which may not reflect reality
